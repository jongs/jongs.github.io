I like to start things. 

I  love starting companies and running them:

    - Mixtent (storylane) helped people build online identities. It was acquired by Facebook
    - Fashmatch helped customers build outfits. It was acquired by Like and later by Google
    - Metabolic helped people improve their nutrition via digital therapeutics. 

I have also helped start companies as non-executive co-founder:

    - Biobridge: remote monitoring for implantable cardiac monitoring devices
    - Sentinel Fresh: logistics software for fresh produce 

I like investing and advising, very early, often pre-product:

    - Clubhouse 
    - Glossier
    - Kin insurance 
    - MasAval
    - Pared
    - Reutrrnly 
    - ...among others. 

Via the acquisition of Mixtent (storylane) I spend about 3 years at Facebook. I helped create the team that launched On This Day, Friendversaries, Year in Review, and other memories related products.
