I like to start and grow software companies.
I founded  Mixtent (Storylane), which was acquired by Facebook, and Fashmatch, acquired by Like, and soon after, by Google. 

I am co-founder of [Pauca](https://www.pauca.co/), creator of [UDP](https://udpapp.com/) an asset optimization platform for real world assets, [Matilda Explorations](https://matildaexp.com/) a community that connects the best engineers in Latin America with full-time remote opportunities at the best U.S startups, [BioBridge](https://gobiobridge.com/), a remote cardiac device monitoring company, among others. 


I like to invest and advise early-stage companies, often pre-product. Examples include Aven, Clubhouse, Glossier, Kin, Pared, Returnly, among others. 

Via the acquisition of Mixtent (Storylane) I spend about 3 years at Facebook, where I helped create the team that launched On This Day, Friendversaries, Year in Review, and other memories related products.

I started this site to tinker with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and motivate myself to write and reflect more about the topics I care about.
