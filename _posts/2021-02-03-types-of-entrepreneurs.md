I have noticed three main recurrent [archetypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_archetypes) in entrepreneurs: artisans, business people, and politicians. These, I think, are core motivations or predispositions that drive entrepreneurs to start new companies. 

Artisans can singularly materialize ideas. They take pride in their work, pleasure in practice, and enjoy the process of increasing abilities over time. Their goal can be building [something others can’t](https://about.google/our-story/), building something simpler than others, or something more fun or beautiful. [The artisan attends to details and respects the creative process. ](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3497-you-know-one-of-the-things-that-really-hurt)

Business people want power, principally in the form of money, but often they also wish for fame. They look for [opportunities in others’ margins ](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/706779-your-margin-is-my-opportunity)or for products where they can charge [luxury margins](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/722081). The biggest strength is a deep understanding of [what people want to use and pay](https://www.ycombinator.com/). 

Politicians want to change the world. They want a group of people (which can include the entire human race) to [relate to each other](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/325530) or to the[ world around them](https://www.tesla.com/about#:~:text=Tesla's%20mission%20is%20to%20accelerate,to%20drive%20than%20gasoline%20cars.) in a different and better way. They recognize that business is an excellent way for the creative and independent-minded to make a dent in the world. 

No one is just one of these archetypes. Entrepreneurs tend to have different combinations of the three. To illustrate this idea, below I speculate on the archetype configurations of three famous entrepreneurs:

One of the reasons these three guys are legendary is that they are the best in the world in one of these archetypes and top 95% on the other two. 

They did not start this way; people change and learn. As a result, these archetypes are not static: each person may start more heavily weighted on one dimension and change over time. 

These three gentlemen are among the best in the world. Most people can’t excel even in one single dimension, and those few that do rarely can also be excellent at the others. Others are well balanced but not world-class level at none of these dimensions. 

Luckily entrepreneurs don’t need to be the best in the world to add value. People of all skills and predispositions (the artisan, the business person, and the politician) create tons of value every day when applying their ingenuity to improving people’s lives. 

Likely, what type of value entrepreneurs create will be influenced by their archetypes: some will bring better products, others cheaper products, and others novel products that change how we interact with each other and the world around us.

I find these archetypes useful in understanding my evolving motivations and understanding other entrepreneurs’ motivations. They serve as a useful mental model to use, at least for me (hopefully for you too?), when thinking about entrepreneurs.
