Food has changed the history of many nations. It provided global recognition for Thailand, cultural integration for Mexico and is could provide political change for Venezuela, thanks to its growing network of Areperas. 


In 2002, the Thai government launched the [Global Thai Initiative,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_cuisine#Culinary_diplomacy) providing financing, marketing, and other forms of support to grow the number of Thai restaurants worldwide. The initiative worked, boosting the global count of Thai restaurants from 5,000 at launch to 10,000 by 2011.

This culinary initiative, known as [Gastrodiplomacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culinary_diplomacy), is a strategic tool practiced in various forms by many governments. These initiatives are not just about increasing food exports and tourism but about fostering a sense of national awareness and goodwill for the nation. 

Food also enters diplomacy indirectly via immigration. Take Mexico: there has been a steady increase in immigration from Mexico to the USA over the past century. As a result, [1 in 10 restaurants in the USA serves Mexican food](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/01/11/about-1-in-10-restaurants-in-the-us-serve-mexican-food/). Here is another crazy stat: [99% of Americans have a Mexican restaurant in their county! \
](https://thehill.com/latino/4401087-report-99-percent-of-u-s-residents-have-a-mexican-restaurant-in-their-county/) \
Over 30 million people in the US traced their ethnic origin to Mexico, out of about 10% of the total US population. In the United States, everyone knows what a taco is. As a result, when things happen in Mexico, Americans are aware and care. 

I have been watching a similar phenomenon in the place with Venezuelans. From 2010 to 2021, Venezuela was the fastest-growing Hispanic group in the USA. As a result, t[he number of Venezuelan restaurants ](https://rentechdigital.com/smartscraper/business-report-details/united-states/venezuelan-restaurants)is growing fast. Venezuelan restaurants have 1% of the market share of Mexican ones, but people increasingly find Venezuelan food: 10 years ago, few knew what an arepa was; nowadays, [many](https://www.tiktok.com/@clx.icons/video/7381969926992547077) [do](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/n6h5GwO6UpQ). Last week, a Slovakian friend living in Upstate New York encountered Venezuelan food at his local market. The word is going around, and Venezuelan food is growing in popularity. 

Hugo Chavez and his Mini-me, Mr. Maduro, are responsible for the[ largest non-war immigration ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_refugee_crisis)and one of the largest reversals of immigration in history. This massive emigration was prompted by[ dramatic contraction in the size of the economy ](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/venezuela-crisis#:~:text=Turbulent%20economy.,reach%208%20percent%20in%202024.)and out-of-control [corruption, crime, and violence](https://www.icip.cat/perlapau/en/article/violence-corruption-and-organized-crime-in-venezuela/). As a consequence, Venezuelan culture is exported to the rest of Latin America, the US, and the world. Where Venezuelans go, the food follows. And wherever there is food, there is an opportunity to do some gastrodiplomacy. 

Like similar governments before, the Chavista regime has exported a ton of Venezuelan dissidents, who take their food wherever they go. Through their food, Venezuelans share their country's story with the rest of the world. 

Twenty years ago, people worldwide had to read or visit to learn about Venezuela. Today, each Arepera is a culinary embassy, most likely run by a dissident of the Chavista regime.

After enduring a [long list of cheats and acts of violence](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/fraught-path-venezuelas-elections-2024-07-24/), the Venezuelan opposition recently managed to accumulate i[ncontrovertible evidence that they won the latest presidential elections by a landslide](https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-maduro-machado-biden-gonzalez-a625eb01979bc9cf5570d03242f198b1).

The government declared itself the winner, while its electoral body refused to show proof to support the claim. The Venezuelan people have overwhelmingly turned to the streets, and the government is back to its tried-and-true tactics.

At this moment, the government is hunting, killing, jailing, and harassing dissidents. They are limiting access to social media (traditional media is already under government control) and threatening the nation with further isolation to secure their hold on power. After 21 years of failed government, Chavez and Maduro have proved they rather govern over the ruins of a nation that let go of power. 

If you live anywhere outside of Venezuela, you likely have been in touch with its culture, food, and amazing people. Venezuela is now at a critical junction, the darkest hour, but also the most hopeful moment: for the first time, Venezuela has in Maria Corina Machado the right leader for the right time, with incredible popular and political support. 

If you want to know what to do or how to help, contact your Venezuelan friends or visit your favorite Arepera. Hear firsthand the plight of a once-thriving nation and the promise of a bright future if we seize this moment and enact a long-awaited change. 

Twenty years ago, when this dark chapter of Venezuela started, you probably knew little to nothing about Venezuela. Now you know. 

Everyone can help: Call your representatives and ask for more pressure on the Chavista government and more support for Maria Corina and the opposition. Share and inform others. Donate. Eat an arepa and get to know Venezuela a bit better. You will see that the country and its people have a moral and worthy cause deserving of everyoneâ€™s support.
