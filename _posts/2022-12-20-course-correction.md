My most excellent overheard experience was at a ski lift. This was 13 years ago, and I was trying to learn how to snowboard. I took one class, tried different things on the slopes, and felt a ton, r but also paid attention to the conversations people had on the lift. They would talk about what went right and what went wrong, and I would try to learn from what they said.

In one of these conversations, someone asked his friend how he avoids making mistakes and falling. The friend said: “oh, I do make tons of mistakes, I just correct them before I fall”

He explained that much of what he does with snowboarding is a function of a misstep he took a second prior that needs correcting. Wherever he is going with the board was often heavily influenced but the error he previously made.  

This is a version of the famous Miles Davids quote: “It’s not the note you play that’s the wrong note – it’s the note you play afterward that makes it right or wrong.” 

This is also a version of the famous Antonio Machado verse, which my father is a big fan of quoting in all possible situations: “caminante, no hay camino, se hace camino al andar” (“walker, there is no path, the path is made by walking”)


This is also a version of this cool Tim Urban (waitbywhy author) graph:




All of these point to one insight: there is no right path and there is no point in looking back; there is only course correction.

 Stuart Kaufman has a beautiful way of thinking about the edge of chaos. For him the context is biology, but I believe it applies to power as well: “Matter has managed to evolve as best it can. And we are at home in the universe. It’s not Panglossian, because there’s a lot of pain. You can go extinct, or broke. But here we are on the edge of chaos because that’s where, on average, we all do the best”

At times when  the alternatives seem to be the conservation of power structures or their complete destruction, I think finding creative ways to diffuse power is an important, interesting, and profitable endeavor.
